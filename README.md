Notes for testing: In order to test data_random.txt and data_sorted.txt, type in one of the file names in the terminal (either "data_random.txt" or "data_sorted.txt"). Then check "output.txt" for results. If you want to check the other one, rerun the program and input the other file name. Then check "output.txt" for new results.
